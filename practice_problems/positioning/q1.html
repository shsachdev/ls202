      In 2015, Bangladesh A came visiting. They were up against Karnataka and this is where Prasidh Krishna got a
      taste of top-flight cricket. He was 19 and picked up 5 wickets. This was the first impression and well,
      an impression had been made. Before this, he showed his prowess in the Karnataka Premier League and
      things were starting to roll for him.Somerset seamer Craig Overton will remain with
      the group having originally arrived as illness cover, but England should also have
      pace duo Jofra Archer and Mark Wood back in contention for next week’s third Test at Port Elizabeth.
      On a re-laid Eden Gardens track, Prasidh was sharp and hostile. He had the pace
      and he had Dinesh Karthik willing to back him to the hilt. There was success, but it did not
      come at a galloping pace. Last year, he was the leader of the pack and even bowled a super over
      against Delhi Capitals.

      Tamil Nadu on Wednesday named a strong team comprising ace off-spinner Ravichandran Ashwin and
      the experienced Dinesh Karthik and Abhinav Mukund for the next two Ranji Trophy games against Mumbai
      and Railways. The team led by Vijay Shankar will take on Mumbai at the M A Chidambaram stadium here
      from January 11 while it meets Railways here from January 19. Ashwin, who played the first two matches of the season,
      against Karnataka and Himachal Pradesh, which Tamil Nadu lost, returns to the squad for the crucial game
      against Mumbai. Dinesh Karthik and left-handed opener Mukund too are back after having missed three matches. They
      featured in the first match against Karnataka. Test discard Murali Vijay, however, is not part of the squad,
      having missed out since the season-opener against Karnataka at Dindigul.

      Tuesday night in Indore was one such opportunity when Thakur showcased his bowling variations that flummoxed the
      Sri Lankan batsmen. His 4/27 at Colombo’s Premadasa Stadium in March, 2018 are still his best T20 figures,
      but Thakur will look back at Tuesday’s match with satisfaction that he has been able to make a mark again.
      In a game where all focus was on Jasprit Bumrah’s injury comeback, Thakur took three wickets—all in one over—to
      set up India’s seven-wicket win. He bowled a fine spell, giving away only 23 runs while producing his
      variations—from short ball to knuckle ball to slower ones. “I feel T20 is such a short format there is always
      going to be ups and downs. The more you play, the more experienced you get and you keep learning,” Thakur told
      the media after the match. “(The) four-day and five-day formats are more settled, you have time to think about your game,
      but in T20 you don’t. So, whenever you practice you need to add to your strengths and keep bettering your skills.
      Over a period of time while practising I have been developing my skills. By playing in the last two-three years in IPL,
      domestic cricket, I am getting better,” he said. In 2015, Bangladesh A came visiting. They were up against Karnataka
