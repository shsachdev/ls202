HTML gives content structure and meaning by defining that content as, for example,
headings, paragraphs, or images. CSS is a presentation language created to style the
appearance of content - using, for example, fonts or colors.

The two languages - HTML and CSS - are independent of one another and should remain
that way. CSS should not be written inside of an HTML document and vice versa.

As a rule, HTML will always represent content, and CSS will always represent the appearance
of that content.

The 3 common HTML terms you should begin with are *elements*, *tags*, and *attributes*.
